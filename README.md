# Movie Times

![demo gif](https://github.com/Ahseeah/movie-times/blob/master/src/images/movietimesdemo.gif)

A two-person project to create a webpage displaying movies now playing in theaters. I focused on the homepage, navigation, and refactoring code, while my partner focused on the movie-detail child pages, integration, and styling. 

Built using <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">React Router</a> and an external <a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction">API</a>.
